                p:`The World Wide Web started with a number of web pages connected 
                by hyperlinks. Soon users felt the need to interact more with web pages.
                So Netscape asked one of its employees, Brendan Eich, to develop a new language for 
                this purpose for the company's browser. Due to the fierce competition between Netscape and
                Microsoft in the browser market, it was necessary to do this very soon.\n
                Within 10 days, Ike invented an application language by adapting some concepts from
                languages such as Perl, Java, AWK, Scheme, etc., which he named Mocha. But later it was
                renamed to LiveScript and then very soon to JavaScript. The reason for using this name was the
                popularity of the Java language at that time. But this naming can generally lead to the conclusion
                that JavaScript is a simplified version (or interpreter version) of the Java language. In fact,
                there is no special connection between Java and JavaScript. The only similarity between the two
                is that they are both programming languages (like other languages), but there is no special
                similarity or connection with it.\n
                JavaScript first appeared in the second version of the Netscape Navigator browser in 1995.
                About a year later, Microsoft developed a similar reverse-engineered language that was
                embedded in the third version of Internet Explorer, called JScript. The reason for this
                naming and not using the JavaScript name was to prevent problems with copyright 
                infringement. Because the name Java was registered as a trademark by Sun Microsystems,
                which was also a competitor to Microsoft. But despite the different naming, JavaScript
                and JScript were almost identical in every way.
                JavaScript (and JScript) quickly gained popularity. JavaScript was a very simple language to 
                learn and get started, which led to the rapid growth of this language in creating dynamic web 
                pages. Of course, this simplicity of JavaScript was also a drawback. Because so many people 
                now start working with JavaScript without fully understanding the meaning of the code, in many
                cases the code is copied from each other. As a result, early on, a lot of buggy and poor
                quality code spread across JavaScript on the Web. JavaScript also found a number of negative
                applications. Like popup ads popping up on web pages.`

                {
                    h:"Browser Wars",
                    p:`JavaScript became very popular when Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet 
                    Explorer 4 were released. At this time, Microsoft began to use a new term called
                     Dynamic HTML, or DHTML for short. DHTML was meant to use JavaScript to dynamize and 
                     interact more with web pages. To increase the popularity of JavaScript (and JScript),
                      Microsoft and Netscape began adding new features to the language. Unfortunately, this
                       effort led to many problems.
                    Features added to this language and how to use them in Internet Explorer and Netscape
                     Navigator were not the same. As a result, it was very difficult to write a program in 
                     JavaScript that ran the same way in both browsers. This rivalry between Microsoft and
                      Netscape led to the emergence of a new term called Browser Wars. As a result, 
                      professional programmers did not take JavaScript very seriously and likened it to a 
                      toy (this thinking still exists among some older programmers). But the problem was not
                       the JavaScript language, but the way the two companies competed.             
                    Eventually Microsoft won the browser war and Internet Explorer became the
                     template browser in the browser market. Also, to address the incompatibility between
                      different browsers, different organizations developed standards for web-related
                       languages. So JavaScript programmers and browser developers began using these 
                       standards, which were developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Ecma
                        International standardization organization.      
                    Firefox open source browser launched in 2002. Apple Safari browser was released in 2003,
                     both of which had good support for standards. As a result, developers could write better
                      software with JavaScript that would run well in different browsers.`

                    p:`
                    In 2005, sites such as Google Maps, Flickr, and Gmail emerged that showed that JavaScript
                     could be used to build powerful Rich Web Applications and create software similar to
                      Native Desktop Applications in the Web. . At the same time, the term Ajax, which stands
                       for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, was coined by Jesse James Garrett.
                    Ajax was actually a way to get information from the server in the background. So that 
                    without the need to reload the web page, the required information is received from the
                     server and only the required parts of the web page are updated with the received 
                     information. This method was soon used on many websites. As a result of the rise of Ajax,
                      experienced programmers turned their attention to JavaScript. Gradually, 
                      the idea spread among professional programmers that JavaScript could be a flexible 
                      and powerful programming language for creating quality web-based software.`

                    p:`With the use of JavaScript in more advanced and sophisticated software, as well 
                    as browser support for new standards, the JavaScript climate also changed. For the 
                    second time, the browser war started. But this time the battle was not over adding new
                     features to the browsers. Rather, it was a war for greater support for standards as well 
                     as speeding up JavaScript execution. The war began when Google introduced a new 
                     JavaScript interpreter in 2008 called the V8 or V8 Engine, which was built into Google
                      Chrome and ran JavaScript applications significantly faster than other browsers. . 
                    Nowadays, in modern browsers, the speed of JavaScript execution has increased a lot 
                    compared to that time, and it seems that this increase in speed and these optimizations
                    in JavaScript interpreters will continue.`

                    p:`HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML language standard. But HTML5 is 
                    more than just a standard for a markup language. In fact, the term HTML5 refers 
                    to a set of the latest standards and technologies used in the web. Like HTML, CSS3, 
                    and a lot of JavaScript programming interfaces (APIs) that we'll cover in Chapter 14 of 
                    this book.
                    HTML5 was finalized in 2014. Then in 2016 version 5.1 and in 2017 version 5.2 were
                     released, which is currently the latest version of this language. This standard is 
                     rapidly gaining ground among web developers, and JavaScript also play a key role in its
                      implementation.
                    Around 2005, when serious efforts were made to make changes to existing Web standards to
                     bring the Web environment closer to the desktop environment, a new term called Web 2.0 
                     emerged. Web 2.0 refers to a new generation of web-related standards and technologies 
                    that aim to enhance browser capabilities and bring the browser programming environment 
                    closer to the desktop programming environment.`

                p:`In 1996, Netscape and Sun Microsystems decided to work with Ecma International to develop
                 a standard for JavaScript. The standard was named ECMAScript to prevent infringement of the 
                 trademark of the Java trademark owned by Sun. This can be a bit confusing for beginners 
                 trying to get started with JavaScript, and the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript 
                 is usually not clear to beginners. Of course, this confusion will be resolved over time. In 
                 short, ECMAScript is a standard that describes a programming language with specific features.
                And JavaScript is an example of an ECMAScript or an ECMAScript implementation. Any person or
                 organization can create an ECMAScript-based programming language and choose a name of their
                  choice. For example, another relatively popular ECMAScript-based programming language is
                ActionScript, which is used in Flash software. It should be noted, however, that although 
                JavaScript and ActionScript are both based on the ECMAScript standard, they are not the same 
                language.
                In fact, an ECMAScript-based programming language can add features as needed. 
                The important point is that all the features of the ECMAScript standard must be implemented
                 in that language. But there are no restrictions on adding new features. And as we will see
                  throughout this book. JavaScript has many features that are not part of the ECMAScript
                 standard and have been added according to the needs of the programming environment
                  (ie web environment or browser).
                Ideally, we expect JavaScript programs to run in the same way in all browsers. Because all
                browsers follow ECMAScript. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and sometimes
                browsers do not succeed in implementing some of the features of this language. Of course,
                the extent of these inconsistencies is very small and is decreasing over time.
                The first version of the ECMAScript standard was released in 1997. A year later, the second
                version was released with minor changes, and in 1999, the third version of the standard was
                released with the addition of several new features. Work then began on the fourth version of
                the standard. But there were many differences in the standardization of this version.
                Because some people believed in adding powerful and complex features to ECMAScript. And
                some, in order to avoid the complexity of the language as well as the complexity of the
                interpreter implementation for this language, believed in adding few and simple features.
                Eventually, these differences led to the abandonment of the fourth version. 
                This means that the fourth version for ECMAScript was never released. After a while,
                work began on the fifth version, and ECMAScript 5 was finally released in 2009 with few 
                changes from ECMAScript 3.
                After the release of ECMAScript 5, or ES5 for short, work began on the next version of the
                standard codenamed "Harmony". This version included many powerful features that were 
                previously planned for ES4, but never came to fruition. There were also other new features 
                for this version, which extended the finalization time of this standard, despite much effort.
                Finally, after 6 years, in 2015, the final ECMAScript 6 or ES6 standard was officially released
                under the official name ECMAScript 2015.                
                It was then decided that instead of releasing a new version of the standard every few years
                with many changes from the previous version, a new version with minor changes would be 
                released in June each year. And to this day, this promise has been fulfilled, and in June
                2016, 2017 and 2018, the ES7, ES8 and ES9 standards were released, respectively. Of course,
                their official names are ECMAScript 2016, ECMAScript 2017 and ECMAScript 2018, respectively.
                The changes that have been made to ECMAScript in the last three versions are generally much 
                less than the changes made to the 2015 version, or ES6. In fact, ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 is the
                latest version of this standard, which has undergone significant changes compared to its previous
                version.                
                This book tries to cover the latest changes to this standard and the JavaScript programming 
                language. But you should 
                always note that after a new 
                version of ECMAScript is released, 
                it will take some time for browsers 
                to support the new features of 
                this version.                
                Recent versions of all popular browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, now 
                support nearly 100% of the features of ECMAScript 2016 or ES7. But support for ES8 and ES9 is 
                a bit of a hassle, which will definitely be fixed in the near future. But you should note 
                that while browsers are adapting to current standards, newer standards are always being 
                developed and published. As a result, browsers' support for the latest version of the 
                standards is always incomplete, and it usually takes about 1 to 2 years from the release 
                of a new version of the ECMAScript standard for different browsers to support 
                that version well.`

                a dramatic increase in the use of one-page software (SPA), of which JavaScript is the beating 
                heart of this type of software. The next generation of software is Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
                , which run on mobile devices and behave similarly to the device's native software. 
                HTML5-based games have also grown significantly, with JavaScript playing a key role in these 
                types of games.
                JavaScript and HTML5-related technologies can be used to produce a variety of software, 
                such as web browser extensions, Windows desktop widgets, Chrome OS software, and more. 
                JavaScript can also be used in many non-web related software. For example, we can write 
                scripting in a PDF file, connection to the database, the Internet of Things, artificial

                The popularity of Node has led to a new type of JavaScript software development known

                p:`When programming (in any language), you need to define a new name in many cases. 
                These letters are used to store the various values ​​needed to run the program. For example, 
                you might use a url to maintain the URL of your current web page. From now on, you will see 
                an abundance of these types of letters in this book, which are called "identifiers". 
                Each programming language has its own rules for naming identifiers. JavaScript also has 
                the following rules for naming IDs.
                1) An identifier can be formed by putting together a number of characters of the 
                alphabet (Latin or non-Latin), numbers, the underscore "_" (Underscore) and the 
                character "$".
                2)The first character of an ID must not be 
                a number
                3)The ID must not be one of the reserved 
                words`

                number of unnecessary suggestions and rules that you should follow when naming IDs.
                Follow the Camel case naming method. In this method, all the characters of 
                an identifier are written in lower case. And only if an identifier consists 
                of more than one word, the first letter of the words (except the first word) is 
                written in capital letters. Examples of Camel case-based denominations can be found 
                in the following identifiers.`

                h:"",
                p:`Note that JavaScript is a case sensitive language. That is, uppercase and lowercase 
                letters are not the same in identifiers. As a result, IDs like myName are different from 
                IDs like myname, MYNAME, and mYnAmE.
                Try to use meaningful identifiers. For example, if you use an identifier to store the answer 
                to a question, using letters like p or hh is not appropriate at all, and it is better to use 
                a meaningful name like answer or even pasokh. This will make your program more readable.
                One of the most valid and usable identifiers in JavaScript is the "$" one-character 
                identifier. But it is recommended that you never use this ID. This is because the popular 
                jQuery library used in many web pages today uses the same identifier. As a result, using this 
                ID on web pages that also use jQuery can cause problems.`

                repeated.
