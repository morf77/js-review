Soon users felt the need to interact more with web pages.\n                So Netscape asked one of its employees, Brendan Eich, to develop a new language for \n                this purpose for the company's browser. Due to the fierce competition between Netscape and\n                Microsoft in the browser market, it was necessary to do this very soon.\n\n                Within 10 days, Ike invented an application language by adapting some concepts from\n                languages such as Perl, Java, AWK, Scheme, etc., which he named Mocha. But later it was\n                renamed to LiveScript and then very soon to JavaScript. The reason for using this name was the\n                popularity of the Java language at that time. But this naming can generally lead to the conclusion\n                that JavaScript is a simplified version (or interpreter version) of the Java language. In fact,\n                there is no special connection between Java and JavaScript. The only similarity between the two\n                is that they are both programming languages (like other languages), but there is no special\n                similarity or connection with it.\n\n                JavaScript first appeared in the second version of the Netscape Navigator browser in 1995.\n                About a year later, Microsoft developed a similar reverse-engineered language that was\n                embedded in the third version of Internet Explorer, called JScript. The reason for this\n                naming and not using the JavaScript name was to prevent problems with copyright \n                infringement. Because the name Java was registered as a trademark by Sun Microsystems,\n                which was also a competitor to Microsoft. But despite the different naming, JavaScript\n                and JScript were almost identical in every way.\n                JavaScript (and JScript) quickly gained popularity. JavaScript was a very simple language to \n                learn and get started, which led to the rapid growth of this language in creating dynamic web \n                pages. Of course, this simplicity of JavaScript was also a drawback. Because so many people \n                now start working with JavaScript without fully understanding the meaning of the code, in many\n                cases the code is copied from each other. As a result, early on, a lot of buggy and poor\n                quality code spread across JavaScript on the Web. JavaScript also found a number of negative\n                applications. Like popup ads popping up on web pages."},{h:"Browser Wars",p:"JavaScript became very popular when Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet \n                    Explorer 4 were released. At this time, Microsoft began to use a new term called\n                     Dynamic HTML, or DHTML for short. DHTML was meant to use JavaScript to dynamize and \n                     interact more with web pages. To increase the popularity of JavaScript (and JScript),\n                      Microsoft and Netscape began adding new features to the language. Unfortunately, this\n                       effort led to many problems.\n                    Features added to this language and how to use them in Internet Explorer and Netscape\n                     Navigator were not the same. As a result, it was very difficult to write a program in \n                     JavaScript that ran the same way in both browsers. This rivalry between Microsoft and\n                      Netscape led to the emergence of a new term called Browser Wars. As a result, \n                      professional programmers did not take JavaScript very seriously and likened it to a \n                      toy (this thinking still exists among some older programmers). But the problem was not\n                       the JavaScript language, but the way the two companies competed.             \n                    Eventually Microsoft won the browser war and Internet Explorer became the\n                     template browser in the browser market. Also, to address the incompatibility between\n                      different browsers, different organizations developed standards for web-related\n                       languages. So JavaScript programmers and browser developers began using these \n                       standards, which were developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Ecma\n                        International standardization organization.      \n                    Firefox open source browser launched in 2002. Apple Safari browser was released in 2003,\n                     both of which had good support for standards. As a result, developers could write better\n                      software with JavaScript that would run well in different browsers."},{h:" Web 2.0",p:"\n                    In 2005, sites such as Google Maps, Flickr, and Gmail emerged that showed that JavaScript\n                     could be used to build powerful Rich Web Applications and create software similar to\n                      Native Desktop Applications in the Web. . At the same time, the term Ajax, which stands\n                       for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, was coined by Jesse James Garrett.\n                    Ajax was actually a way to get information from the server in the background. So that \n                    without the need to reload the web page, the required information is received from the\n                     server and only the required parts of the web page are updated with the received \n                     information. This method was soon used on many websites. As a result of the rise of Ajax,\n                      experienced programmers turned their attention to JavaScript. Gradually, \n                      the idea spread among professional programmers that JavaScript could be a flexible \n                      and powerful programming language for creating quality web-based software."},{h:"standards",p:"With the use of JavaScript in more advanced and sophisticated software, as well \n                    as browser support for new standards, the JavaScript climate also changed. For the \n                    second time, the browser war started. But this time the battle was not over adding new\n                     features to the browsers. Rather, it was a war for greater support for standards as well \n                     as speeding up JavaScript execution. The war began when Google introduced a new \n                     JavaScript interpreter in 2008 called the V8 or V8 Engine, which was built into Google\n                      Chrome and ran JavaScript applications significantly faster than other browsers. . \n                    Nowadays, in modern browsers, the speed of JavaScript execution has increased a lot \n                    compared to that time, and it seems that this increase in speed and these optimizations\n                    in JavaScript interpreters will continue."},{h:"HTML5",p:"HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML language standard.

In fact, the term HTML5 refers \n                    to a set of the latest standards and technologies used in the web. Like HTML, CSS3, \n                    and a lot of JavaScript programming interfaces (APIs) that we'll cover in Chapter 14 of \n                    this book.\n                    HTML5 was finalized in 2014. Then in 2016 version 5.1 and in 2017 version 5.2 were\n                     released, which is currently the latest version of this language.

The standard was named ECMAScript to prevent infringement of the \n                 trademark of the Java trademark owned by Sun. This can be a bit confusing for beginners \n                 trying to get started with JavaScript, and the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript \n                 is usually not clear to beginners. Of course, this confusion will be resolved over time. In \n                 short, ECMAScript is a standard that describes a programming language with specific features.\n                And JavaScript is an example of an ECMAScript or an ECMAScript implementation. Any person or\n                 organization can create an ECMAScript-based programming language and choose a name of their\n                  choice. For example, another relatively popular ECMAScript-based programming language is\n                ActionScript, which is used in Flash software. It should be noted, however, that although \n                JavaScript and ActionScript are both based on the ECMAScript standard, they are not the same \n                language.\n                In fact, an ECMAScript-based programming language can add features as needed. \n                The important point is that all the features of the ECMAScript standard must be implemented\n                 in that language. But there are no restrictions on adding new features. And as we will see\n                  throughout this book. JavaScript has many features that are not part of the ECMAScript\n                 standard and have been added according to the needs of the programming environment\n                  (ie web environment or browser).\n                Ideally, we expect JavaScript programs to run in the same way in all browsers. Because all\n                browsers follow ECMAScript. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and sometimes\n                browsers do not succeed in implementing some of the features of this language. Of course,\n                the extent of these inconsistencies is very small and is decreasing over time.\n                The first version of the ECMAScript standard was released in 1997. A year later, the second\n                version was released with minor changes, and in 1999, the third version of the standard was\n                released with the addition of several new features. Work then began on the fourth version of\n                the standard. But there were many differences in the standardization of this version.\n                Because some people believed in adding powerful and complex features to ECMAScript. And\n                some, in order to avoid the complexity of the language as well as the complexity of the\n                interpreter implementation for this language, believed in adding few and simple features.\n                Eventually, these differences led to the abandonment of the fourth version. \n                This means that the fourth version for ECMAScript was never released. After a while,\n                work began on the fifth version, and ECMAScript 5 was finally released in 2009 with few \n                changes from ECMAScript 3.\n                After the release of ECMAScript 5, or ES5 for short, work began on the next version of the\n                standard codenamed "Harmony". This version included many powerful features that were \n                previously planned for ES4, but never came to fruition. There were also other new features \n                for this version, which extended the finalization time of this standard, despite much effort.\n                Finally, after 6 years, in 2015, the final ECMAScript 6 or ES6 standard was officially released\n                under the official name ECMAScript 2015.                \n                It was then decided that instead of releasing a new version of the standard every few years\n                with many changes from the previous version, a new version with minor changes would be \n                released in June each year. And to this day, this promise has been fulfilled, and in June\n                2016, 2017 and 2018, the ES7, ES8 and ES9 standards were released, respectively. Of course,\n                their official names are ECMAScript 2016, ECMAScript 2017 and ECMAScript 2018, respectively.\n                The changes that have been made to ECMAScript in the last three versions are generally much \n                less than the changes made to the 2015 version, or ES6. In fact, ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 is the\n                latest version of this standard, which has undergone significant changes compared to its previous\n                version.                \n                This book tries to cover the latest changes to this standard and the JavaScript programming \n                language. But you should \n                always note that after a new \n                version of ECMAScript is released, \n                it will take some time for browsers \n                to support the new features of \n                this version.                \n                Recent versions of all popular browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, now \n                support nearly 100% of the features of ECMAScript 2016 or ES7. But support for ES8 and ES9 is \n                a bit of a hassle, which will definitely be fixed in the near future. But you should note \n                that while browsers are adapting to current standards, newer standards are always being \n                developed and published. As a result, browsers\' support for the latest version of the \n                standards is always incomplete, and it usually takes about 1 to 2 years from the release \n                of a new version of the ECMAScript standard for different browsers to support \n                that version well.'}],mysource:"https://www.pentalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ecmascript-versions-evolution.jpg"},{id:"3",title:"The future of JavaScript",text:[{h:"everywhere",p:"These days it is very exciting for JavaScript.

For example, if you use an identifier to store the answer \n                to a question, using letters like p or hh is not appropriate at all, and it is better to use \n                a meaningful name like answer or even pasokh. This will make your program more readable.\n                One of the most valid and usable identifiers in JavaScript is the "$" one-character \n                identifier. But it is recommended that you never use this ID. This is because the popular \n                jQuery library used in many web pages today uses the same identifier.
